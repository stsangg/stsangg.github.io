	<p class='P3'>UX research, Interaction design, Branding, UI design</p>
	<div class='intro'>
		<p class='P1'>This project came from noticing everybody's detest while waiting in line, and research confirmed that anxiety, stress, and uncertainty are just a few of the negative emotions experienced if encountering an unexpected wait time. While local businesses do display their peak hours for people to know, there is no actual system in place to provide action to avoid wait times and the emotions that come with it.</p>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='P3'>Solution</p>
	<p class='P1'>Queue creates a central place for communication between people and local businesses. The app helps avoid lengthy wait times through options to join a virtual Queue, make a reservation, and even order from a menu ahead of time. The result? People feel in control of their time with transparent information about a business' wait times and reservation availabilities.</p>

	<p class='P3'>Impact</p>
	<p class='P1'>This was a fictional project. I recognized this was a common problem that was exacerbated by the pandemic. As a designer, I wanted to practice my skills and see what I could design to solve the problem.</p>

<div class='section' id='research1'>
	<p class='P3'>Primary research</p>
	<p class='H2'>Understanding people's thoughts and emotions</p>
	<p class='P1'>I assumed that people were not a fan of waiting in line, but, I wanted to know why. I focused on answering:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Why are people so angry and frustrated when waiting in line?</li>
		<li>What contributes to their poor experiences?</li>
		<li>Do people ever have a positive experience while waiting?</li>
	</ol>
	<p class='P1'>Participants shared stories with a similar course of emotions and thoughts. I laid these out on a customer journey map to visualize their experience and see areas of opportunity.</p>

	</div>

	<p class='P1'>Mapping out how the conversion score was calculated provided direction. It showed that the three categories: usability, engagement, and stickiness all affected the brand's overall score. I decided to make them our main tabs and teach the user the impact of each one.</p>

	<p class='P3'>Copywriting</p>
	<p class='H2'>Reducing cognitive load</p>
	<p class='P1'>The research showed a pattern among users who read metric definitions. They were constantly asking themselves how and why the data mattered in relation to their business.</p>

		<p class='caption'>Examples of raw notes where users ask how it relates to their business</p>
	</div>
	<p class='P1'>Taking inspiration from our users, I structured definitions as questions they would ask themselves. I hoped it would help reduce the cognitive load and help them better understand and utilize the metrics.</p>

		<img src='assets/definition-copywriting.png' alt='Example of definition copywriting'>
	</div>
	<p class='caption'>When defininig what sources their site visitors were coming from, what really mattered to them was: “where should they focus their marketing efforts”?</p>

<div class='section' id='UI'>
	<p class='P3'>UI Design</p>
	<p class='H2'>anchoring focus and understanding with cards</p>
	<p class='P1'>I used a card design so the user could focus their attention on one metric (card) at a time. While early iterations were great for showing the data, our users felt overwhelmed by the amount of metrics and wanted more contextual information.</p>
		<img src='assets/test.png'>
		<p class='caption'>Early iterations and options of card designs</p>

		<img src='assets/card-old2.png'>
		<img src='assets/card-old3.png'>
	</div> -->

	<p class='P1'>To mitigate the problem, I decided to create a single layout that could be applied to all cards. I also made it a point to properly define the metric in question format so the user would understand what we were tracking and how to use the information.</p>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='H2'>icons providing visual breaks</p>
	<p class='P1'>To prevent cognitive overload, I looked for places to replace text with icons. I used the ones below to represent the main categories.</p>
	<div class='section-mid-align'>
		<img src='assets/icons.png'>
	</div>
	<p class='P1'>The icons helped break up text and provide opportunities to communicate information on a page that could be easily scanned without sacrificing information.</p>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='H2'>Final product</p>
	<p class='P1'>The app is currently being developed. In the meantime, my energy is directed towards usability testing with our brands. Though research has been used to design features, we’ve also made some assumptions. In my testing, I’ll be focusing on validating the information architecture and ensuring users and understanding the icons.</p>
