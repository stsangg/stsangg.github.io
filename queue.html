		<h6>Background</h6>
		<p>A long time issue in our society is wait times. 
Given the current climate of the COVID-19 pandemic, wait times have now extended past restaurants to other businesses where indoor traffic needs to be controlled. </p></div>

	<h6>Design Opportunity</h6>
	<p>A study done on the social and
psychological perspective of wait times showed that anxiety, stress, and uncertainty are just a few emotions people experience while waiting. What could be done to address the emotional frustration that people felt?</p>

<h6>Design Solution</h6>
<p>By creating an online experience for people to view information about their local businesses and their live wait times, they have transparency and control to efficiently go about their day. </p>

<h5>Why are people frustrated from waiting? </h5>
<p>I went into this project with the assumption that people hated waiting in line. <b>But, I wanted to know why.</b> Why were people so angry and frustrated while waiting, and did they ever have positive experiences waiting in line?</p> </div>

<img class='text-box' src='images/queue/user-interviews.svg' alt='User Interviews'>

<div class='section'>
<p>When asking people to give a negative experience they had waiting in line, I noticed that all participants went through a similar process. To summarize my findings, I created a customer journey map to visualizee the different steps and feelings people go through.<br>

By laying out all the steps, I was able to brainstorm and visualize where Queue’s features could plug in and help. </p>

<h5>It’s a competitive space</h5>
<p>There’s no shortage of competitor applications that have similar features to what I wanted for Queue. I looked to other applications I found during preliminary research or what was mentioned in interviews. By doing a feature comparison, I got a general idea of what was already offered in the market space and the best practices that people were expecting. </p>

	<h5>It’s more than just displaying wait times</h5>
	<p>The research challenged my assumption that just displaying wait times was enough. The takeaways I had indicated the large room for potential solutions that Queue could provide. Using the HMW statements created, I did several quick brainstorming sessions to expand on how I could approach the problem of waiting in line.<br>

Following IDEO's guidelines, subsequent sessions were spent finding common themes amongst the ideas and further conceptualizing into final features. .</p>

<h4>Usability Testing</h4>
<h5>Testing  design flows</h5>
<div class='columns'>
	<div class='column-left'>
<p>For the first round of usability testing, I wanted to focus on the task flows of newly implemented features. My goals were to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Assess the task flow of the new features in the prototype</li>
	<li>Evaluate the current layout - is everything where they expected it to be?</li>
	<li>Gather feedback on what else participants would want to see incorporated within the prototype</li>
</ol>

<p>Before starting each session, I asked the participants to rate their experience level with using applications that provided local business information on the Likert scale (1-5), with 5 being “expert”. <br>
Those who rated themselves with more experience (4+) provided more detailed feedback about the flow of the prototype. The goal of each participant using such an application was to find ratings and reviews of the business.</p>
</div>
<div class='column-right'>
	<p><b>Participants:</b>three</p>
	<p><b>Age group:</b>24-35 years old</p>
	<p><b>Method:</b>remote concept usability and task-based testing</p>
	<p><b>Measuring success:</b><br>
	Areas where less than 60% of users ran into problems meant that an iteration may have been needed</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Breaking down the raw data into individual traits from each user participant, I created an affinity map to see where the most common problems were happening. This helped me prioritize what I should iterate on. </p>
<iframe style='margin:0 auto' width="902" height="375" src="https://miro.com/app/embed/o9J_kg3uRsg=/?pres=1&frameId=3074457351196581451" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>The general flow of the prompted tasks went smoothly. They all had a 100% completion rate. However, it was the details in the prototype where I uncovered the areas that users had uncertainty. <br>

66% of users wished for more clarity and instructions throughout the application. If they were navigating new features such as ordering a meal ahead of time, they wanted to know details such as if they were ordering for only themselves, or if their meal would be ready when they arrive. </p>
</div>

<img class='text-box' src='images/queue/usability1-1.svg'>

<div class='section'>
<p>To pay from the application, 100% of users weren’t expecting to be able to click on the reservation to access more options. They thought of the “queues” page as only a quick overview or a way to make changes.</p>
</div>

<img class='text-box' src='images/queue/usability1-2.svg'>

<div class='section'>
<h5>Making the most out of little time</h5>
<div class='columns'>
	<div class='column-left'>
<p>This time around, I was mainly focusing on the UI design of the prototype and testing the iterations made to the task flows. Maze was used for remote, unmoderated testing because it allowed me to collect more responses within a short time frame. My goals were:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Test the changes to the task flow for checking active queues and paying for a meal</li>
	<li>Assess the UI design</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class='column-right'>
	<p><b>Participants:</b>sixteen</p>
	<p><b>Age group:</b>24-35 years old</p>
	<p><b>Method:</b>unmoderated testing</p>
	<p><b>Measuring success:</b><br>
	Areas where more than 70% of users run into problems means that an iteration should be considered</p>
</div>

<h5>Finding the right fit</h5>
<p>The biggest takeaway from this round of testing was that I needed to revise my shade of orange. Previously, I was using brighter shades to promote the friendliness. I hand’t considered how it would work with the rest of the elements on the screen. <br>
I turned to headspace’s palette of classic, muted colors. While their colours were meant to soothe and calm users, I used their colour palette as a starting point of inspiration. </p>

	<h4>Branding guide</h4>
	<h5>Queue is friendly, trustworthy, and professional </h5>
	<p>Queue’s brand is meant to act like a messenger between the customers and businesses. Keeping it professional will help establish customer trust, but incorporating a level of friendliness will further the customer-application relationship.</p>
