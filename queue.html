		<h6>Background</h6>
		<p>Have you ever arrived somewhere and been faced with a long line that you didn’t expect? <a href='https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-disneyland-ride-wait-time/'>If you’re at Disneyland, people will happily wait in that line for over an hour.</a> But, unlike Disneyland, there’s little to do in a grocery store checkout line except look around or down at your phone. Wait times seem to be prevalent everywhere throughout our society. Given the current climate of the pandemic, wait times are even exacerbated when going to businesses with controlled indoor traffic. </p></div>

	<h6>Design Opportunity</h6>
	<p>A study done on the social and
psychological perspective of wait times showed that anxiety, stress, and uncertainty are just a few emotions people experience while waiting. What could be done to address the emotional frustration that people felt?</p>

<h6>Design Solution</h6>
<p>By creating an online experience for people to view information about their local businesses and their live wait times, they have transparency and control to efficiently go about their day. </p>

<p>I went into this project with the assumption that people hated waiting in line. <b>But, I wanted to know why.</b> Why were people so angry and frustrated while waiting, and did they ever have positive experiences waiting in line?</p> </div>

	<h5>Understanding people’s thoughts, questions, and emotions</h5>
<p>I noticed that participants all had a similar emotion and thought process when explaining a negative experience waiting in line. To summarize my findings, a customer journey map was the best way to show the steps and feelings, and visualize where Queue’s features could plug in and help.</p>

<h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
<h5>Looking at the features in the competitive space</h5>
<img src='images/queue/competitors.svg'>
<p>From the preliminary research, I found that there is no shortage of competitor applications that also connect customers to local businesses. I turned to capterra.com and sitejabber.com, both a reputable reviews website, and compared the competitiors based on features, reviews, and comments left over the past year. I got a general idea of what was already offered in the market space and the best practices that people were expecting. </p>

	<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
	<h5>Creating for the users</h5>
	<p>Using POV and HMW statements created, I did several brainstorming sessions to come up with creative solutions that would solve people’s pain points.<br>
Following IDEO's guidelines, subsequent sessions were spent finding common themes amongst the ideas and further conceptualizing into final features.</p>

<h4>Task flows</h4>
<h5>Asking how people can achieve their goal</h5>
<p>With my features in mind, I created a chart depicting the different task flows that a user could take depending on their wants. This helped me show how many screens would need to be created, and potentially where I could minimize lengthy task steps. </p>

<h4>Wireframes</h4>
<h5>Creating and choosing the best designs</h5>
<p>To test out different ideas and layouts for the screens I needed, I created a collection of low fidelity wireframes.</p>

<h4>First usability testing</h4>
<h5>Testing  design flows</h5>
<div class='columns'>
	<div class='column-left'>
<p>For the first round of usability testing, I wanted to focus on the task flows of newly implemented features. My goals were to:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Assess the task flow of the new features in the prototype</li>
	<li>Evaluate the current layout - is everything where they expected it to be?</li>
	<li>Gather feedback on what else participants would want to see incorporated within the prototype</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the mid-fidelity wireframes, I created an interactive prototype to be used for testing.</p>
</div>

<div class='column-right'>
	<p><b>Participants:</b> three<br>
	<b>Age group:</b> 24-35 years old<br>
	<b>Method:</b> remote task-based interviews<br>
	<b>Measuring success:</b><br>
	- min. 70% of users can complete the task<br> 
- less than 70% of users are confused<br>
- overall positive feelings towards the design </p>
</div>
</div>

<img class='midfi' src='images/queue/midfi.png'>

<div class='section'
<p>Breaking down the raw data into individual traits from each user participant, I created an affinity map to see where the most common problems were happening. This helped me prioritize what I should iterate on. </p>

<h6>Affinity Map</h6>
<p>The general flow of the prompted tasks went smoothly. They all had a 100% completion rate. However, it was the details in the prototype where I uncovered the areas that users had uncertainty.</p>
<iframe style='margin: 0 auto' width="902" height="375" src="https://miro.com/app/live-embed/o9J_kg3uRsg=/?moveToViewport=1127,-2174,6639,3657" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no" allowFullScreen></iframe>

<p>66% of users wished for more clarity and instructions throughout the application. If they were navigating new features such as ordering a meal ahead of time, they wanted to know details such as if they were ordering for only themselves, or if their meal would be ready when they arrive. </p>
</div>

<img class='text-box' src='images/queue/usability1-1.svg'>

<div class='section'>
<p>To pay from the application, 100% of users weren’t expecting to be able to click on the reservation to access more options. They thought of the “queues” page as only a quick overview or a way to make changes.</p>
</div>

	<h4>Second usability testing</h4>
<h5>Making the most out of little time</h5>
<div class='columns'>
	<div class='column-left'>
<p style='margin-bottom:0px'>This time around, I was mainly focusing on the UI design of the prototype and testing the iterations made to the task flows. Maze was used for remote, unmoderated testing because it allowed me to collect more responses within a short time frame. My goals were:
</p>
<ol style='margin-top:0px'>
	<li>Test the changes to the task flow for checking active queues and paying for a meal</li>
	<li>Assess the UI design</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class='column-right'>
	<p><b>Participants:</b> sixteen<br>
	<b>Age group:</b> 24-35 years old<br>
	<b>Method:</b> unmoderated testing<br>
	<b>Measuring success:</b><br>
	- areas with less than 70% of confusion or misclicks<br> 
- rating a task less than a 4/10 for difficulty <br>
- minimal complaints towards UI design</p>

<h5>Finding the right fit</h5>
<p>The biggest takeaway from this round of testing was that I needed to revise my shade of orange. Previously, I was using brighter shades to promote the friendliness. I hadn't considered how it would work with the rest of the elements on the screen. <br>
I turned to headspace’s palette of classic, muted colors. While their colours were meant to soothe and calm users, I used their colour palette as a starting point of inspiration. </p>

	<h4>Branding guide</h4>
	<h5>Queue is friendly, trustworthy, and professional </h5>
	<p>Queue’s brand is meant to act like a messenger between the customers and businesses. Keeping it professional will help establish customer trust, but incorporating a level of friendliness will further the customer-application relationship.</p>
