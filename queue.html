		<h6>Background</h6>
		<p>A long time issue in our society is wait times. 
Given the current climate of the COVID-19 pandemic, wait times have now extended past restaurants to other businesses where indoor traffic needs to be controlled. </p></div>

	<h6>Design Opportunity</h6>
	<p>A study done on the social and
psychological perspective of wait times showed that anxiety, stress, and uncertainty are just a few emotions people experience while waiting. What could be done to address the emotional frustration that people felt?</p>

<h6>Design Solution</h6>
<p>By creating an online experience for people to view information about their local businesses and their live wait times, they have transparency and control to efficiently go about their day. </p>

<h5>Why are people frustrated from waiting? </h5>
<p>I went into this project with the assumption that people hated waiting in line. <b>But, I wanted to know why.</b> Why were people so angry and frustrated while waiting, and did they ever have positive experiences waiting in line?</p> </div>

<img class='text-box' src='images/queue/user-interviews.svg' alt='User Interviews'>

<div class='section'>
<p>When asking people to give a negative experience they had waiting in line, I noticed that all participants went through a similar process. To summarize my findings, I created a customer journey map to visualizee the different steps and feelings people go through.<br>

By laying out all the steps, I was able to brainstorm and visualize where Queue’s features could plug in and help. </p>

<h5>It’s a competitive space</h5>
<p>There’s no shortage of competitor applications that have similar features to what I wanted for Queue. I looked to other applications I found during preliminary research or what was mentioned in interviews. By doing a feature comparison, I got a general idea of what was already offered in the market space and the best practices that people were expecting. </p>

	<h5>It’s more than just displaying wait times</h5>
	<p>The research challenged my assumption that just displaying wait times was enough. The takeaways I had indicated the large room for potential solutions that Queue could provide. Using the HMW statements created, I did several quick brainstorming sessions to expand on how I could approach the problem of waiting in line.<br>

Following IDEO's guidelines, subsequent sessions were spent finding common themes amongst the ideas and further conceptualizing into final features. .</p>

<h6>Task flows:</h6>
<p>With my features in mind, I created a chart depicting the different task flows that a user could take depending on their wants. This helped me show how many screens would need to be created, and potentially where I could minimize lengthy task steps. </p>
