<p> Before approaching the users, I wanted to understand the market, industry standards, and common frustrations that existing companies were facing. <br><br>
In fast fashion, companies utilized the consumer-driven mindset. Consumers were always be looking for fresh looks, fast. <br>
If consumers couldn’t buy or find the item of clothing they were looking for, they would not hesitate to look elsewhere. <br>
With the rise of sustainable manufacturing, people wanted to know the manufacturing details of their product and 46% were willing to pay higher prices for these goods. </p>

    <div id='interview-data'> 
      <ol><dl>
        <li><dt><b>Users enjoy product reviews</b></dt>
<dd>When shopping with a brand, people may initially have an underlying distrust with
companies they infrequently use. 3/5 users said they do not trust the company description
and photographs, as “they’re obviously trying to sell me something”. From here, 5/5 users
used reviews as proven testimonies from other successful (or unsuccessful) customer
purchases as a factor in their decision. 4/5 users also relied heavily on competitor product
  and price research to see if they were truly getting their money’s worth.</dd></li>
        <li><dt><b>Users are more inclined to use brands they have established trust with</b></dt>
<dd>From the interviews, 3/5 users stated that they preferred to use brands they had
established a trusting relationship with. This was developed through consistent positive
experiences with factors such as customer service, positive communication between
company and user, and straight forward return policies. They would also rely less on
competitor research and product reviews (point 1). It can be interpreted that the user wants
to feel appreciated and respected by the company they have chosen to spend their money
  with.</dd></li>
        <li><dt><b>Users have deeper product consideration when shopping online</b></dt>
<dd>Due to shipping fees and other hidden costs such as custom and duty fees, online
shoppers end up paying more than just the cost of the product on a website. This
contributes to why 4/5 users said they either have to do online competitive research or
deeply think about an item before purchasing. Furthermore, any waived additional fees or
offered discounts/promotions from the company was a motivator for 5/5 of the usersmaking
them feel like they’re getting some value back from the company and that they’re
spending their money wisely. Waived fees would bring the overall product cost down to
what the user would pay in store, and they’d be more inclined to purchase the item. When
given free shipping and returns, 2/5 users said that they shopped with less restraint. An
example given was where they ordered two different sizes of the same item if they were
  unsure of the fit.</dd></li>
        <li><dt><b>Users enjoy the convenience with online shopping</b></dt>
<dd>From the interviews, 5/5 users stated that they liked the convenience of online shopping. It
saved them time from having to go to the store and finding the item they were looking for.
They didn’t have to leave their home, they could conveniently shop “on-the-go” wherever
  and whenever, and their product would ship straight to their door.</dd></li>
        <li><dt><b>Users need reassurance and support</b></dt>
<dd>4/5 users stated that when shopping online, they missed having the option of a sales
associate to assist them. They would use the sales associate for help finding an item or
offering opinions regarding choices. 2/5 users said they “miss the attention”. This connects with point 2 (brand trust) as a sales associate can contribute to a positive customer service
  experience and subsequent brand trust.</dd></li>
        <li><dt><b>Users enjoy having options</b></dt>
<dd>5/5 users liked to online shop because they felt they had access to greater variety of
options that would not be offered in their local store. Tied with point 6 (convenience of
shopping), they also enjoyed being able to not just browse products, but use filters to
narrow their search to browse specific categories. The option of having a wish list or ‘save
for later’ function was common amongst 3/5 users, where an item peaked their interest but
not enough to purchase yet. They liked having being able to save the item in what they call
a “second cart”, and have the option to return to it if they changed their mind. A wish list
almost plays into the indecisive nature of some individuals, giving them a sense of
reassurance (point 5) that they can always return to purchase the item if they change their
  mind.</dd></li>

    <h5> Persona </h5> <!-- Persona -->
    <p>The interviews showed three different archetypes of the typical online shopper. <br>Olivia Miller was a detailed creation of the 'saavy shopper' archetype (user #1 and #4)- a busy go-getter who shops online at least once per week and prioritizes convenience, and the best price and quality. The insights above were also included in Olivia's persona as they were common across all interviews. By incorporating them, I was able to design for the wider audience that Mirrors ultimately hoped to appeal to.<br>

    <h5>My assumption was wrong: users had two unique mental models.</h5>
      <p id='sub-header'> Information Architecture</p>
    <p>It was important to find out how and where a user would think to look for a product on the site.<br> 
A remote card sorting activity with 30 (hypothetical) products was conducted to discover the users’ mental models. </p>
    
    <div>
      <img class='IA-description' src='../images/similarity-matrix.png' alt='Similarity Matrix'>
      <p>I originally assumed that only traditional category labels (ie. tops/bottoms) would be used. The card sorting results showed otherwise. Instead of one, people actually had two types of categories when grouping products. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Traditional group labels</li>
          <li>Traditional group labels</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In short, the results showed that the <b>specificity of a product name</b> determined the category users thought they'd be under. By incorporating a <b>mix of traditional category labels and more specific category labels</b>, Mirrors would be able to satisfy both unique mental models.
      </p> </div>

      <!--SITE MAP-->
      <div class='sitemap'>
      <h5>High level overview of page relationships</h5><p id='sub-header'> Site Map</p>
    <p>Using the two types of category labelling, a site map was created to visually depict the relationship between pages on the site. <br>Products were organized in <b>traditional groupings and activity-based groupings.</b></p>

    <h5>Interface Design</h5>
    <p>One of the best parts of the design process was Mirrors’ rebranding. For their e-commerce debut, they wanted a fresh revamp of their branding colors and logo.<br>However, they wanted to still stay true to their roots and maintain their core brand attributes.</p>
    <div class='attributes'>
      <span>Clean</span>

    <h5> User Interface Kit</h5>

      <p>As I write this case study, I look back at this project fondly. During this time, I applied everything I learned and received the full end to end experience as a product designer. The art of fashion was always something I loved to explore, but also learning the business behind the industry was awesome.</p>
      <ol id='learnings'>
        <li>During a short period of time, I was exposed to a lot of design patterns in the e-commerce space. I learned to understand the design decisions behind each one, and how to find the relevant patterns and best practices.</li><br/>
        <li>Fashion is also a business, people! During the project, I learned the importance of taking the time to establish business and user goals. By taking this moment, I found similarities in both, and that overlap was the foundation for my designs. </li></ol>
