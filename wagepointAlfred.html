		<p class='P1'>Wagepoint, the “world’s friendliest payroll software”, has built itself over the past 10 years using a sales-first approach to their customers. When it came to redesigning of our software with a focus on payroll compliance, we also needed to redesign our back-end system to support the new heavy feature sets (multitude of features?) we were providing customers.<br>
		Due to technical bugs and system architecture problems, Wagepoint’s current back-end system is filled with bandaid solutions to support the daily functions of our finance team..</p>

	<p class='P3'>Summary</p>
	<p class='P1'>Leading the redesign of our 2.0 back-end system (‘Alfred’), I designed a dashboard that focused on transparency around the different journeys of a customer’s payroll and provided flexible solutions to solve for each unique case.</p>
</div>

<div class='section container-md'>
	<p class='P3'>Impact</p>
	<p class='P1'>Alfred is currently being built! Accounting for the time currently spent on daily tasks and the new features slated to be built, we’ve estimated that our finance team (our users!) will save roughly 7 hours per day.</p>

<div class='section container-md'>
	<p class='P3'>Primary research</p>
	<p class='H2'>Identifying systemic problems</p>
	<p class='P1'>I started by creating a flow chart to understand the complexity of the finance world. This helped identify where the problems were occurring in their current workflow. The exercise also made it abundantly clear we couldn’t silo each section of their process in individual flows. An action taken in one section could affect three others.</p>

	<div class='section-mid-align'>
		<img src=''>
	</div>

	<p class='P1'>Lengthy conversations and the flow chart identified three major problems to tackle:</p><ol>
		<li>Limited functionality to deal with problems that could arise while a payroll is being processed</li>
		<li>Five different spreadsheets being used to track problems and communications with customers</li>
		<li>Back-end code needing to be manipulated for things the system missed</li>

<div class='section container-md'>
	<p class='P1'><b>In addition to features we needed to improve on</b></p>
	<p class='P1'>Presentations to stakeholders resulted in a lot of questions about unaccounted use cases. A big barrier to the project’s success was realizing that business decisions still needed to be made. The project was at risk of being severely delayed, so I facilitated meetings with stakeholders to decide what features should be prioritized. This helped to create a open dialogue between executives on their positioning on back-bending actions currently being done for customers that supported our “world’s friendliest payroll software” branding vs. taking a hard stance and empowering our customers to use our system effectively. This was a major turning point for realizing that our product needed to move from a sales-first approach to a product-first approach.</p>

<div class='section container-md' id='copywriting'>
	<p class='P3'>Ideation</p>
	<p class='H2'>Mapping out concepts</p>
	<p class='P1'>We spent countless 5-hour meetings building and designing the new workflow with the finance team. We found it extremely valuable to incorporate people across various levels. Individual contributors on the front lines could provide minute details to help design interactions, while executives helped shape project scope by making macro-level business decisions. With the collective brain power, we reduced the original 30+ use cases down to 19. Eventually, we connected the use cases together and created what we call, the greatest flowchart of all time.</p>

<div class='section container-md' id='UI'>
	<p class='P3'>Design</p>
	<p class='H2'>An object first approach</p>
	<p class='P1'>Time to design! I took an object-first approach and focused actions around our main attraction, payroll transactions. By using this, we could show:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>When a problem occurs</li>
		<li>Available solutions to resolve the problem</li>
		<li>Historical records and actions taken to resolve the problem</li>
	</ol>
	<p class='P1'>The below screens show this journey: A net pay collection transaction has been processed by the system, but later had non-sufficient funds (NSF) and couldn’t continue its journey. When an NSF occurs, we build on top of the transaction details to show the problem, available solutions, and later provide historical records.</p>

	<p class='P1'>We learned from our earlier communication issues with the stakeholders. Instead of doing a traditional presentation, we created a screen flow with annotations. Coupled with our technical requirements and the GFAT, the resources helped bridge their understanding of the new system. Due to the project’s time constraints and the complexity of the interactions, we refrained from creating a prototype.</p>

<div class='section container-md'>
	<p class='P3'>Technical implementation</p>
	<p class='H2'>Bringing in a technial perspective</p>
	<p class='P1'>This project was one that showed me the value of including a developer early in the process. When it came time for hand-off, our CTO had opinions on areas of improvement while taking into account system performance and scalability. His insight was extremely valuable because it determined what could reasonably be built within our constrained time frame.</p>
	<p class='P1'>To reduce system load and optimize performance, we iterated on the flow to generate bank files. Originally, the team would generate a preview of the bank file and be able to see all the transactions on it. Since there could be over 100,000+ transactions, our CTO predicted the system load would be too great.</p>
	<div class='section-mid-align'>
		<img src=''>
	</div>
	<p class='P1'>This prompted further discussions with individual contributors on the finance team. We discovered what really mattered was seeing the file’s total transaction value. If they needed to see a transaction, they’d often be finding a specific one.</p>
	<p class='P1'>With this in mind, we increased the capability of the filters so the team could use stronger criterion to find a specific transaction.</p>
	<div class='section-mid-align'>
		<img src=''>
	</div>
	<p class='P1'>After iterating on a few more flows, I supported our CTO as a product manager while he built the system’s architecture. As the one who was the closest to the project, I explained technical concepts and facilitated meetings with executives for business decisions, design, and technical implementations. </p>
	<p class='P1'>The system is currently being built! This case study will later be updated with quantitative metrics. Stay tuned!</p>

	<p class='H2'>What a journey</p>
	<p class='P1'>This project was my most difficult one to date. The journey was 10 months was long and I came away with many learnings.</p>
	<p class='P1'><b>It's okay to ask for help</b></p>
	<p class='P1'>I was drowning in the project for the first 3 months trying to understand the subject matter and design a system without first establishing a realistic scope. Flagging concerns early on, recognizing the need for business decisions, and bringing in executives really helped.</p>
	<p class='P1'><b>Document organization</b></p>
	<p class='P1'>I had research findings, lo-fidelity screens, and feedback all over the place. Not only did a messy “project environment” make it hard to bring other people into the project, but it also discouraged me from opening files! Keeping everything organized in a single place and getting tips from my team on how they manage their documents helped me ideate and find a solution that worked for me.</p>
