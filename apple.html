<h4>01. Overview</h4>
<div class='overview-columns'>
	<div style='width: 70%; padding-right: 80px;'>
	<h5>Background</h5>
	<p>Apple’s native Calendar app was pre-installed in the 40.8 million iPhones sold in the 3rd quarater of 2019. For many users, this is often the main app they use so their information is connected across their Apple devices.</p></div>

		<h5>Design Opportunity</h5>
		<p>Currently, the Calendar and Reminders app are two separate applications on the iOS system.
Despite having different task flows, they ultimately share the same goal: reminding the user of an
upcoming item.
Can the Calendar and Reminders apps be combined for easier user convenience?</p>

<h5>Design Solution</h5>
<p>It became apparent that there was a real need for task management integration in the Calendar application. The new features motivate people to stay on top of their schedule in an organized and structured format.</p>

<div>
<h5>My Day Tab</h5>
<p>At a quick glance, instantly know where you are in your day with the chunked schedule view, and what you need to do in the tasks view. The productivity tracker helps motivate people to complete their tasks and close their rings.</p></div>
</div>

		<h5>Project management made easy</h5>
		<p>Hate the days where you’re stressed and overbooked? When choosing a due date for a task, this feature conveniently shows the pre-scheduled events so people know if their schedule needs to be changed to avoid burnout.</p></div>

<h4>02. Research</h4>
<h5>Understanding the needs</h5>
<p>This project stemmed from my own frustrations of using the application. However, my own experiences weren't enough to warrant a new design. I wanted to know if my frustrations were shared by others, and who I would be designing for. </p>

<h6>User Interviews</h6>
<ol>
	<li>People need a central location to view their upcoming
due dates and events because it’s more convenient and
easier to plan their schedule.</li>
<li>Users need to stay motivated and on track because they
need to complete their tasks by the due date.</li>

<li>Both calendar and list views are necessary because
people like to easily scan the due dates in a list view but
sometimes need their calendar to plan tasks around their
pre-scheduled events.</li>

<li>People use a variety of features to manage their tasks, with due dates being the first.</li></ol>

<p>Based on the different methods that people use to organize their tasks, I created two personas. They were used as a reference point to make sure that the new features captured both their needs.</p>

</div>

<h5>What did the competitors do?</h5>
<p>I looked to other popular applications that people used or mentioned in the interviews. By doing a feature comparison and analysis of their task flows, I got a general idea of how people expected the application to be laid out.</p>
</div>

<h4>03. Ideating</h4>
<h5>How to reinvent the wheel</h5>
<p>Adding a new feature to the calendar application meant really pushing the boundaries of Apple's current designs. I spent several sessions brainstorming ideas from the research findings, with the first session not worrying about feasibility.</p>
<img class='image' src='images/apple/brainstorm.svg' alt='Brainstorming'> 

<p>Following IDEO's guidelines, subsequent sessions were spent finding common themes amongst the ideas and further conceptualizing. The final features I decided on were:</p>

<h4>04. Design</h4>
<h5>Wireframes</h5>
<img class='image' src='images/apple/frames-lofi.svg' alt='Low fidelity Wireframes'>

<h5>Staying true to Apple's brand</h5>
<p>Since I was adding a feature to Apple's native application, it was important that I stayed within Apple's visual branding designs. I used their <a href='https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/' target='_blank'> material design kit</a> to create the following wireframes, and used the <a href='https://www.figma.com/proto/YKYCgEWL0PskgqG3kEcevA/Apple-Calendar-Task-Management?node-id=82%3A747&viewport=334%2C204%2C0.05840155854821205&scaling=scale-down' target='_blank'>Figma prototype</a>to receive feedback from potential users. I decided on their signature shade of blue to use the highlight color throughout the app. Given that the nature of the application can easily cause stress or anxiety when viewing a busy day, I hoped that the blue would provide feelings of ease and calmness. </p>

<div class='section'>
<h4>05. Usability Testing</h4>
<p>With the personas' goals in mind, the usability testing focused assessing the core functionalities of the design:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>providing a one-stop-shop experience for people to plan their schedule</li>
		<li>offering a basic structure for people with different management methods</li>
		<li>motivating users to stay on track with their day</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I conducted a remote usability testing, starting with concept usability questions to collect participant reactions to the My Day and improved calendar features. I followed this up with task-based questions to assess the flow for creating and editing lists and tasks.</p>

<p>Based on the interviews, I created an affinity map and categorized the user feedback based on the features that were tested.</p>

<h5>What needed improvement</h5>
<p>Before starting the session, I asked each participant to rate their level of experience with using task management applications on a scale of 1 to 3, with 3 being "expert". Participants who rated themselves 1 (no experience at all) were able to complete all the tasks, but were confused at the relevance of certain features such as sections or tags. This reinforced the need for a clear onboarding process for new users to know what functionalities are available to them. I also re-examined whether some features were actually necessary for the final product.</p><br>
<img class='image' src='images/apple/frames-iterations.svg' alt='Iteration Frames' style='max-width:90%;'>

<h5>Apple's accessibility problem</h5>
<p>When I was following Apple's fitness application UI, I noticed that the brighter colors chosen were not accessible against their classic white background. This served to be a problem when looking at their Health application, where the activity text was not accessible.<br>

Given the scope of the project, I decided to follow their current UI so the feature looked like it would belong within the application. However, it should be noted that the colors may need to be iterated in the future to be accessible to all potential users. </p>

<h4 id='final-prototype'>>06. Final Prototype</h4>
<p>In addition to the above, I made further iterations to the prototype. The final is below.</p>

	<h4 style='margin-top: 100px;'>07. Learnings</h4>
	<ol><dl>
		<li><dt>Creativity isn't linear</dt></li>
		<dd>Initially, it was hard to creatively design a solution and not just mimic what was already on the market. However, having brainstorming sessions showed that some of the best ideas do not occur all at once, linearly. I learned that "frankenstein-ing" different elements from different ideas can make that diamond in the rough. This taught me perseverance, to push through at least the first five (hardest) minutes of the session. Once that brain is warmed up, the creative juices will flow.</dd>
		<li><dt>Always doublecheck</dt></li>
		<dd>All designers are human, and this is something I may have forgotten as I often look up to current designers as role models. This project reminded me of this fact, and taught me to never just blindly follow a company's visual UI. By adhering to my own codes and double checking the details of my work, I discovered the accessibility issue. I hope to one day be a part of making that iteration!</dd>
