    <h6>Background</h6>
    <p>Northville Rehabilitation Centre is a multidisciplinary clinic located in Markham, ON. This is the
second location that the owners have opened, with the first location having been in operation for
over 30 years. Though word of mouth is currently their primary source of referrals, Northville
would like to expand their marketing efforts and audience demographic.</p></div>

  <h6>Design Opportunity</h6>
  <p>As a new and local rehabilitation clinic, Northville’s goal is to increase their number of walk-ins and referrals. With over 55% of millenials researching their healthcare online (and finding it just as reliable as a doctor), Northville hopes to establish its online presence and align its values with this younger demographic and the community.</p>

<h6>Design Solution</h6>
<p>By creating an educational and responsive website, Northville hopes to capture the younger millenial demographic. Revamped copywriting will help succintly inform website visitors on offered clinic services and their benefits. Coupled with an intuitive informational architecture, website visitors can easily navigate around and make an informed decision about their health.</p></div>

  <h4>Empathy Map</h4>
  <h5>Understanding the average user</h5>
  <p>I created an empathy map based on the collective data to help remind me of the user expectations that I was designing for.</p><p style='color:#535353'>I found that the redesign had to be focused around the assumption that the average user had no prior knowledge of any medical or rehabilitation terminology.</p></div>

  <h4>Competitor task flow comparison</h4>
    <h5>What’re the best practices in existing sites?</h5>
  <img class='competitors' src='/images/northville/competitors.svg' alt='Competitor Logos'>

<p>I assessed four random existing clinic websites based on the top three factors that people considered when choosing a clinic:
  <ol>
    <li>Learning about the offered services</li>
    <li>Whether they accepted their insurance company</li>
    <li>Ease of booking an appointment</li> 
  </ol></p>

  <p>In the end, I hoped to find the best practices and effective organization tactics that competitors used to promote their clinic.</p>
<br>
<h6>Competitor takeaways</h6>
<ol>
	<li>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation</li>
<li>There is no consistent placement for insurance information</li>
<li>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was under a section related to "contact".</li>
</ol>
</div>

<input id='CTA' type='button' value='Detailed Analysis' onclick="myFunction()"></input>
      <div id='secondary-research'>
      	<h5>Learning about the offered services</h5>
<p></p>>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation.Each service had it’s own desinated page, and a description
explaining the following:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>what the treatment or discipline is about</li>
<li>what the therapist will do</li>
<li>what kind of benefits to expect</li>
</ul></p>

<h5>Finding the insurance information</h5>
<p>Interestingly, each site had their own placement of the
insurance information. It was not under its own heading in the global navigation, but
found under different sections such as “FAQ”, “site map”,
“services”, or “pricing”.<br>
This suggests that the clinics think this is secondary information
and don’t place that much priority on it.</p>

<h5>Booking an appointment</h5>
<p>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was a section related to "contact". If the clinic offered online booking, there would be a CTA linking to it.
If the clinic did not offer online booking, the information was usually
under “contact”, organized by location.
Under “contact” was the clinic details, including the address, email,
phone/fax, and hours of operation. Interestingly, not all sites used the
word “contact” in the global navigation. Alternatives would be
“locations” or “about me”.
If there was more than one location, the contact information would be
organized by location on one page.</p>

  <h4>Remote card sorting analysis</h4>
  <h5>Addressing information architecture assumptions</h5>
  <div class='columns'>
  <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 80px;">
  <p>Since I wasn't able to obtain familiar design patterns from competitors, I decided to ask the users msyself through a cardsorting activity. In keeping with the business' goals, it was important to create an architecture that was intuitive to the user’s flow. I wanted to find out:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Where would people look for clinic details?</li>
    <li>Where would people look for insurance information?</li></ol>
</div>

<div>
<h6>Details</h6>
<p>
Platform: remote card sorting activity via OptimalSort<br>
Participants: eight<br>
Number of cards: eight</p>

</figure>
<div class='section'>
<h4>Card sorting takeaways</h4>
<ol>
  <li>“Contact” would be the most likely place people would look to find clinic details</li>
  <li>“Private insurance” or "Extended Health Coverage" are interchangeable terms, and “services” is the most likely place people would look.</li>
</ol>

  <h6>Low fidelity wireframes</h6>
  <p>Thanks to the above learnings, I had a better idea of the type of content needed on the website. It was finally time to design! Since I wasn’t creating any new pages, I referenced the site’s existing site map and drew out potential layouts for diffrent pages. During the weekly check-in, the client and I chose what would be the best. </p>

  <div class='columns'>
    <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 80px;">
     <p>In addition to making layout changes, I also iterated on the “book an appointment” flow. In this round of testing, I kept the questions the same to also assess the UI and chosen colour scheme. My goals for this round of testing were to:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Assess the high-fidelity layout</li>
    <li>Evaluate the effectiveness and/or potential barriers to newly designed task flows</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Based on the data, I created an affinity map to identify the most common, and therefore highest priority, problems.</p>

	<h4>Learnings</h4>
	<<h6>Final thoughts</h6>
<p>Redesigning the website for my old clinic brought back all kinds of nostalgia. I loved being able to take one step towards my goals of returning to the healthcare industry through a design focus to improve the patient user experience. I hope that the redesign helps educate my generation on the benefits of rehabiliative and maintenace therapy to keep the physical body in tip top shape!
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><b>1. Function over form</b></dt>
	<dd>Valuable information can live on a website, but it doesn't necessarily mean users are reading it. With Mailchimp's help, I learned how to create succint content that can educate people without overwhelming them with large bodies of text. Through observing how users navigate (or don't navigate) information-dense sites, I saw how design practices like bullet points, whitespace, and bolded words really make an impact.
</dd><br>
	<dt><b>2. Multiple Flows</b></dt>
	<dd>We learn that people have different mental models when approaching a task. However, seeing it in practice with my design helped me understand that there doesn't have to be one flow us designers create to accomplish a task. The essence of UX is to create an experience that is frictionless to those who use the product. I was stuck in the mindset that I had to create one optimal flow to complete a task, but this showed me that I can provide multiple opportunities throughout the website to cater to different ways of thinking.</dd><br>
	<dt><b>3. Power of colour theory</b></dt>
	<dd>It was great to incorporate Northville's brand colour throughout the site, but that stark colour contrast is what most likely limited the site in its branding. The clinic looked one dimensional in only giving the vibe of professionalism, and it didn't connect with the users. By incorporating the warmer tones, users felt more comfortable while navigating and would be more inclined to trust this clinic with their healthcare.</dd>
