		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Northville Rehabilitation Centre is a multidisciplinary clinic located in Markham, ON. This is the
second location that the owners have opened, with the first location having been in operation for over 30 years. Though word of mouth is currently their primary source of referrals, Northville would like to expand their marketing efforts and audience demographic. </p> </div>

	<h5>Design Opportunity</h5>
	<p style='margin-left: 50px'> Over 55% of millennials research their healthcare information online and
find it just as “reliable” as their doctor. Compared to baby boomers, they were also twice as likely to have a more holistic approach to health, with 71% citing wellness includes both physical and mental health.</p> </div>

<div class='design-sol'>
	<h5>Design Solution</h5>
	<p>By establishing their online presence and creating an educational and responsive website, Northville hopes to target this younger demographic (specifically 20 to 35 years old). With a revamped website, Northville hopes to establish themselves in the community and align their values with their patients. </p>

<!-- RESEARCH SECTION -->
<h4>03. Research</h4> </br>
<h5>Primary Research: contextual inquiry</h5>

<div class='research'>
  
  <div class='research-intro'>
  <h5>Goals</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the user expectations when looking for clinic
information?</li>
<li>What factors help influence their decision making?</li>
<li>What’re their pain points when navigating the website?</li>
</ol>

<h5>Demographic Details</h5>
<p>Targeted age group: 20 - 35 years old<br>
Total participants: five<br>
Gender breakdown: five females<br>
</p>
</div>

<h5>Methodology</h5> <br>
<h6>Assessing the impact of different layouts on user behaviours</h6>
<p>Users were given tasks to complete on three existing clinic websites.
I wanted to see how much of an impact different website layouts would
have on a user’s behaviour and thought processes when completing the
tasks. I also hoped to solidify any patterns that might’ve emerged, and give
the user a chance to figure out what factors they prioritized in their decision
when choosing a clinic.</p>

<h5>Tasks</h5></br>
<h6>I created the tasks based on my initial assumptions from my prior experience working at the clinic. </h6>
<p>When potential clients called into the clinic, the top three frequently asked questions were:
<ol>
  <li>What is the difference betwen physiotherapy and chiropractic treatment</li>
  <li>Do you accept private insurance?</li>
  <li>Can I book an appointment?</li>
</ol></p>

<h5>Task #1: Use the site to see whether a physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment would be better for you</h5>
<h6>People did not understand what they were reading</h6>
<img class='task-1' src='/images/northville/task-1.svg' alt='Task 1'>
<p>This created a problem because there was an increased risk of information being missed. 60% of users would’ve just called or left the site if they couldn’t find what they were looking for. 
Calling for information defeated the purpose of having the it on the website, and adds an extra step to the conversion process.</p>

<h5>Task #2: Do they accept private insurance or extended
health coverage</h5>
<h6>People were overwhelmed when just navigating a site they
thought was too text-heavy</h6>
<img class='research-tasks' src='/images/northville/task-2.svg' alt='Task 2'>
<p>When they were overwhelmed, various outcomes were observed: 
  <ul>
    <li>risk of no trust being developed</li>
    <li>leaving the site in frustration</li>
    <li>calling to find out information, thus adding an extra step to the conversion process</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h5>Task #3: Try to book an appointment</h5>
<h6>People expected to be guided on how they should take action</h6>
<img class='research-tasks' src='images/northville/task-3.svg' alt='Task 3'>
<p>If there was no guidance or instructions on how to book an appointment, users were uncertain whether they had missed an online booking option. This would’ve resulted in calling or emailing (adding an extra step to the conversion) or leaving the site in frustration. </p>

<h5>Primary Research Impressions:</h5>
<p><ol>
  <li>Copywriting needs to be simple so it can be understood by the users</li>
  <li>Keywords are how users navigate the site to fit their needs</li>
  <li>Large bodies of text are often skimmed or skipped</li>
  <li>Users expect clear guidance on how to take action</li>
  <li>Practitioner biographies do not hold as high of a priority as services
information</li>
<li>Information must be easy to find and match people’s mental models</li>
<li>Factors that are users always look for are:<br>
    - services information<br>
    - insurance information<br>
    - how to book an appointment</li>
  </ol></p>
