		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Northville Rehabilitation Centre is a multidisciplinary clinic located in Markham, ON. This is the
second location that the owners have opened, with the first location having been in operation for over 30 years. Though word of mouth is currently their primary source of referrals, Northville would like to expand their marketing efforts and audience demographic. </p></div>

	<h5>Design Opportunity</h5>
	<p> General research on the health behaviours of "millenials" (those born between 1986 to 1996) showed that over 55% research for their healthcare information online and trust it just as much as their doctor. They are also twice as likely to have a more holistic approach to health, with 71% citing health and wellness to include more than just "not feeling sick". This opened up the opportunity to educate the young demographic on the benefits of rehabiliative therapy.</p> 

	<h5>Design Solution</h5>
	<p>In keeping with the habits of the young millenial demographic, I redesigned Northville's website on their current platform, <a href='www.wix.com' target='_blank'>wix.com</a>. However, I recognized that a pretty website would do little to make them unique from the dozens of other local rehabiliation clinics. Thus, I also decided to revamp their content strategy based on the research conducted. By making the content educational and engaging, I hoped to reduce the communication barrier between the general public and rehabiliation industry. </p>

  <h5>Goals</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the user expectations when looking for clinic
information?</li>
<li>What factors help influence their decision making?</li>
<li>What’re their pain points when navigating the website?</li>
</ol></div>

<div>
<h5>Demographic Details</h5>
<p>Targeted age group: 20 - 35 years old<br>
Total participants: five<br>
Gender breakdown: five females<br>
</p></div>
</div>

<h5>Methodology: task-based contextual inquiries and user interviews</h5> <br>
<h6>Assessing the impact of different layouts on user behaviours</h6>
<p>Users were given tasks to complete on three existing clinic websites.
I wanted to see how much of an impact different website layouts would
have on a user’s behaviour and thought processes when completing the
tasks. I also hoped to solidify any patterns that might’ve emerged, and give
the user a chance to figure out what factors they prioritized in their decision
when choosing a clinic.<br>
<span class='highlight'>To test my assumptions, I created a set of tasks based on the three most frequently asked questions I encountered during my working clinic experience.</span></p>

<h5>Task #1: Use the site to see whether a physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment would be better for you</h5>
<h6>People did not understand what they were reading</h6>
<img class='research-tasks' src='/images/northville/task-1.svg' alt='Task 1'>
<p>This created a problem because there was an increased risk of information being missed. 60% of users would’ve just called or left the site if they couldn’t find what they were looking for. 
Calling for information defeated the purpose of having the it on the website, and adds an extra step to the conversion process.</p>

<h5>Task #2: Do they accept private insurance or extended
health coverage</h5>
<h6>People were overwhelmed when just navigating a site they
thought was too text-heavy</h6>
<img class='research-tasks' src='/images/northville/task-2.svg' alt='Task 2'>
<p class='p-sub'>When they were overwhelmed, various outcomes were observed:</p>
  <p><ul>
    <li>risk of no trust being developed</li>
    <li>leaving the site in frustration</li>
    <li>calling to find out information, thus adding an extra step to the conversion process</li>
  </ul></p>

<h5>Task #3: Try to book an appointment</h5>
<h6>People expected to be guided on how they should take action</h6>
<img class='research-tasks' src='images/northville/task-3.svg' alt='Task 3'>
<p>If there was no guidance or instructions on how to book an appointment, users were uncertain whether they had missed an online booking option. This would’ve resulted in calling or emailing (adding an extra step to the conversion) or leaving the site in frustration. </p>

<p class='p-sub'>Primary Research Impressions:</p>
<p><ol>
  <li>Copywriting needs to be simple so it can be understood by the users</li>
  <li>Keywords are how users navigate the site to fit their needs</li>
  <li>Large bodies of text are often skimmed or skipped</li>
  <li>Users expect clear guidance on how to take action</li>
  <li>Practitioner biographies do not hold as high of a priority as services
information</li>
<li>Information must be easy to find and match people’s mental models</li>
<li>Factors that are users always look for are:<br>
    - services information<br>
    - insurance information<br>
    - how to book an appointment</li>
  </ol></p>

  <h5>Secondary research: contextual inquiry</h5>
  <p class='p-sub'>Goals:</p>
  <p><ol>
    <li>Who are the direct competitors?</li>
    <li>What factors do they think are important to promote their clinic?</li>
    <li>How do they lay out the specific factors that users think are
important on their website?</li>
</ol></p>

<img class='competitors' src='/images/northville/competitors.svg' alt='Competitor Logos'>

<p class='p-sub'>From the primary research, the three most important factors when choosing a clinic were: 
  <ol>
    <li>Learning about the offered services</li>
    <li>Whether they accepted their insurance company</li>
    <li>Ease of booking an appointment</li> 
  </ol></p>

<p>
  Four existing rehabiliation clinics were chosen at random.
  <h6>I assessed how they  structured their task flow for the above factors. </h6>
  <br> In the end, I hoped to find best practices and effective organization tactics
used to promote their clinic. </p>

<h5>Learning about the offered services</h5>
<h6>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation</h6>
<p>Each service had it’s own desinated page, and a description
explaining the following:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>what the treatment or discipline is about</li>
<li>what the therapist will do</li>
<li>what kind of benefits to expect</li>
</ul></p>

<h5>Finding the insurance information</h5>
<h6>Interestingly, each site had their own placement of the
insurance information</h6>
<p>It was not under its own heading in the global navigation, but
found under different sections such as “FAQ”, “site map”,
“services”, or “pricing”.<br>
This suggests that the clinics think this is secondary information
and don’t place that much priority on it.</p>

<h5>Booking an appointment</h5>
<h6>Two scenarios arose</h6>
<p>If the clinic offered online booking, there would be a CTA linking to it.
If the clinic did not offer online booking, the information was usually
under “contact”, organized by location.
Under “contact” was the clinic details, including the address, email,
phone/fax, and hours of operation. Interestingly, not all sites used the
word “contact” in the global navigation. Alternatives would be
“locations” or “about me”.
If there was more than one location, the contact information would be
organized by location on one page.</p>

<h5>I created an empathy map based the collective user research data to help remind me of the user expectations I was designing for. </h5>

</div>

<hr class='divider' />

<h4 id='cnav-design'>04. Design</h4>
<div class='copywriting'>
  <h5>Content Copywriting</h5>
  <p>From the user research, it was clear that a copywriting revamp was needed on the website. </p>

<img src='/images/northville/copywriting-stats.svg' alt='Copywriting Statistics'> 

<p>Before doing any writing, I first established the user’s goals and motivations for wanting to read any clinic service information.</p>
<h6><u>Goal:</u> Users wanted to choose the appropriate type of therapy to book with.<br> 
<u>Need:</u> In order to accomplish this, they had to read and learn about the offered services.</h6>

<p class='p-sub'>I referenced Mailchimp’s fantastic style guide and wrote out four questions to focus on:
  <ol>
  <li>What is the service</li>
  <li>How do they carry out their treatment</li>
  <li>What do they treat</li>
  <li>What benefits does their treatment provide?</li>
  </ol></p>
<p>By focusing on answering these four questions, I hoped to provide clarity to prospective users in a concise and digestible format. 
To match Northville’s brand attributes, the content was written in a professional and plainspoken tone.</p>

</div>

<div class='cardSort'>
  <h5>Card Sorting</h5>
  <p>Before building the site, it was important to me to create an architecture that was the most intuitive to the user flow. If I had learned anything from the competitive analysis, it was that:</p>
  <h6>There is no  best “information architecture pattern” for placement of certain information.</h6>

<div class='columns'>
  <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 80px;">
  <h5>High Level Goals</h5>
  <p><ol>
    <li>Where did people think to look for clinic details?</li>
<li>If there was no payment heading, how and where would people look for insurance
information?</li></ol></p></div>
<div>
<h5>Details</h5>
<p>
Platform: remote card sorting activity via OptimalSort<br>
Participants: eight<br>
Number of cards: eight</p></div>

The percentage indicates the number of participants who sorted the card (left) into the corresponding category (top).</figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>Where did people think to look for clinic details?</h5>
<h6>“Contact” would be the most likely place people would look.</h6>
<p>The competitor analysis showed this information under two headings: "contact" and "book now". To figure out where users expected to find these details, I created cards with the clinic phone number and address. The results of the study showed that "contact" won by an overwhelming amount. Only 13% of users categorized the phone number under “book now”, while 75% of users categorized it under “contact”.</p>

<h5>How and where would people look for insurance information?</h5>
<h6>“Private insurance” is the more widely recognized term, and “services” is the most likely place people would look.</h6>
<p>During the research, it became apparent that not all users know the terms "private insurance" and "extended health coverage” are interchangeable. To see which was more recognized, I added both terms into the card sorting. 
38% of users categorized “private insurance” and only 25% categorized “extended health coverage”. I interpreted this to mean that because “private insurance” had a higher percentage, it suggested more recognition.<br> 
I initially suggested placing this under a payment-related heading with the fees of each service, but the client expressed that they did not wish to advertise their prices. If I were to also remove the fee schedule and only show the insurance policy, it would risk causing confusion to the users. There was a clear user expectation to see service prices under a payment-related heading. In the competitor analysis, each site also had its own placement of the insurance information.
Interestingly, the highest percentages for both “private insurance” and “extended health coverage” was under the category "services". This suggested that out of the pre-determined categories, this is where majority of the users would think to look.<br>
In a surprise twist, the footer category was also shown to be a second option with 25% of users. This is most likely because users use the footer as a place to re-orient themselves or find extra information.</p>

<h4 id='cnav-improvements'>06. Improvements</h4>
<p>Aside from layout changes, the major thing that needed to be changed was the “booking an appointment” task flow. I had created the first set of wireframes with the notion that only one flow could be created and I had to design the most intuitive and popular one. Boy, was I wrong. <br>

<span class='highlight'>The results from the first round of usability testing showed me not one, but three different flows that users had when approaching this task.</span></p>

<h4>06. Improvements </h4>
<p>As indicated from above, this round of testing showed that all possible task flows were intuitive for incoming users. This was a huge win as the first round of testing showed some major problems (yikes). <br>

The second round of improvements mainly focused on the UI and visual elements.</p>

<img class='homepage-comparison' src='images/northville/homepage-example.png' alt='Homepage Comparison'>
<p>I originally wanted to stick within Northville’s signature brand colour of royal blue. It was seen throughout the site, and in different elements on the homepage. 
Though it really stayed within their brand attributes of professionalism, users felt offput from seeing so much of the royal blue. <br>

In the iterated version, I decided to incorporate more colours on the site. <span class='highlight'>Since the royal blue already provided a professional brand attribute, I wanted to incorporate warmer tones that would make users feel more comfortable while navigating an information-dense site.</span> I also hoped that it’d help further instill brand trust within the company.   </p>
