    <h6>Background</h6>
    <p>Northville Rehabilitation Centre is a multidisciplinary clinic located in Markham, ON. This is the
second location that the owners have opened, with the first location having been in operation for
over 30 years. Though word of mouth is currently their primary source of referrals, Northville
would like to expand their marketing efforts and audience demographic.</p></div>

  <h6>Design Opportunity</h6>
  <p>As a new and local rehabilitation clinic, Northville’s goal is to increase their number of walk-ins and referrals. With over 55% of millenials researching their healthcare online (and finding it just as reliable as a doctor), Northville hopes to establish its online presence and align its values with this younger demographic and the community.</p>

<h6 style='margin-top:50px'>Design Solution</h6>
<p>By creating an educational and responsive website, Northville hopes to capture the younger millenial demographic. Revamped copywriting will help succintly inform website visitors on offered clinic services and their benefits. Coupled with an intuitive informational architecture, website visitors can easily navigate around and make an informed decision about their health.</p></div>

  <h4>Competitor task flow comparison</h4>
    <h5>What’re the best practices in existing sites?</h5>

<p>I evaluated four random clinic websites to discover their organization tactics and best practices. I used the <b>top three factors</b> people considered when choosing a clinic: 
  <ol>
    <li>Learning about the offered services</li>
    <li>Whether they accepted their insurance company</li>
    <li>Ease of booking an appointment</li> 
  </ol></p>
  <img class='competitors img-fluid' src='/images/northville/competitors.svg' alt='Competitor Logos'>

<br>
<h6>Competitor takeaways</h6>
<ol>
	<li>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation</li>
<li>There is no consistent placement for insurance information</li>
<li>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was under a section related to "contact"</li>
</ol>
</div>

<input id='CTA' type='button' value='Detailed Analysis' onclick="myFunction()"></input>
      <div id='secondary-research' class='container-md'>
      	<h5>Learning about the offered services</h5>
<p></p>>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation.Each service had it’s own desinated page, and a description
explaining the following:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>what the treatment or discipline is about</li>
<li>what the therapist will do</li>
<li>what kind of benefits to expect</li>
</ul></p>

<h5>Finding the insurance information</h5>
<p>Interestingly, each site had their own placement of the
insurance information. It was not under its own heading in the global navigation, but
found under different sections such as “FAQ”, “site map”,
“services”, or “pricing”.<br>
This suggests that the clinics think this is secondary information
and don’t place that much priority on it.</p>

<h5>Booking an appointment</h5>
<p>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was a section related to "contact". If the clinic offered online booking, there would be a CTA linking to it.
If the clinic did not offer online booking, the information was usually
under “contact”, organized by location.
Under “contact” was the clinic details, including the address, email,
phone/fax, and hours of operation. Interestingly, not all sites used the
word “contact” in the global navigation. Alternatives would be
“locations” or “about me”.
If there was more than one location, the contact information would be
organized by location on one page.</p>

<p><b>Common conditions treated by chiropractic</b></p>
<p>In the beginning, it was hard for users to keep their eye engaged because of the amount of whitespace around elements. In the iterations, I made layout changes to better utilize the page’s real-estate. By introducing a second column for the "common conditions", I took advantage of the user's natural eye movement in the "F" pattern and kept them engaged while reading.</p>
<img class='mob-textbox img-fluid' src='images/northville/mobile/usability1-3.png' alt='Correction 3'>
<p><b>Booking an appointment</b></p>
<p>The original prototype assumed that people would click in the navigation or footer for the contact information to book an appointment. Instead, the testing showed me three other approaches that participants would’ve taken. With such an important task to conversion metrics and business goals, I needed to re-examine the flow and provide more opportunities throughout to improve the flow.</p>

In the iterated version (right), I used warmer tones that would make the people feel more comfortable while navigating an information-dense site. I also hoped that the warmer yellows and blues would help further instill brand trust.</p>

	<h4>Learnings</h4>
	<h6>Final thoughts</h6>
<p>Redesigning the website for my old clinic brought back all kinds of nostalgia. I loved being able to take one step towards my goals of returning to the healthcare industry through a design focus to improve the patient user experience. I hope that the redesign helps educate my generation on the benefits of rehabiliative and maintenace therapy to keep the physical body in tip top shape!
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt><b>1. Function over form</b></dt>
	<dd>Valuable information can live on a website, but it doesn't necessarily mean users are reading it. With Mailchimp's help, I learned how to create succint content that can educate people without overwhelming them with large bodies of text. Through observing how users navigate (or don't navigate) information-dense sites, I saw how design practices like bullet points, whitespace, and bolded words really make an impact.
</dd><br>
	<dt><b>2. Multiple Flows</b></dt>
	<dd>We learn that people have different mental models when approaching a task. However, seeing it in practice with my design helped me understand that there doesn't have to be one flow us designers create to accomplish a task. The essence of UX is to create an experience that is frictionless to those who use the product. I was stuck in the mindset that I had to create one optimal flow to complete a task, but this showed me that I can provide multiple opportunities throughout the website to cater to different ways of thinking.</dd><br>
	<dt><b>3. Power of colour theory</b></dt>
	<dd>It was great to incorporate Northville's brand colour throughout the site, but that stark colour contrast is what most likely limited the site in its branding. The clinic looked one dimensional in only giving the vibe of professionalism, and it didn't connect with the users. By incorporating the warmer tones, users felt more comfortable while navigating and would be more inclined to trust this clinic with their healthcare.</dd>
