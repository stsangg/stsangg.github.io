		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Northville Rehabilitation Centre is a multidisciplinary clinic located in Markham, ON. This is the
second location that the owners have opened, with the first location having been in operation for over 30 years. Though word of mouth is currently their primary source of referrals, Northville would like to expand their marketing efforts and audience demographic. </p></div>

<div class='overview-design'>
	<h5>Design Opportunity</h5>
	<p> General research on the health behaviours of "millenials" (those born between 1986 to 1996) showed that over 55% research for their healthcare information online and trust it just as much as their doctor. They are also twice as likely to have a more holistic approach to health, with 71% citing health and wellness to include more than just "not feeling sick". This opened up the opportunity to educate the young demographic on the benefits of rehabiliative therapy.</p> 

	<h5>Design Solution</h5>
	<p>In keeping with the habits of the young millenial demographic, I redesigned Northville's website on their current platform, <a href='www.wix.com' target='_blank'>wix.com</a>. However, I recognized that a pretty website would do little to make them unique from the dozens of other local rehabiliation clinics. Thus, I also decided to revamp their content strategy based on the research conducted. By making the content educational and engaging, I hoped to reduce the communication barrier between the general public and rehabiliation industry. </p>

  <h5>Goals</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the user expectations when looking for clinic
information?</li>
<li>What factors help influence their decision making?</li>
<li>What’re their pain points when navigating the website?</li>

<h5>Demographic Details</h5>
<p>Targeted age group: 20 - 35 years old<br>
Total participants: five<br>

</div>

<h5>Methodology: task-based contextual inquiries and user interviews</h5> <br>
<h6>Assessing the impact of different layouts on user behaviours</h6>
<p>Users were given tasks to complete on three existing clinic websites.
<span class='highlight'>I wanted to see how much of an impact different website layouts would have on a user’s behaviour and thought processes when completing the
tasks. </span>I also hoped to solidify any patterns that might’ve emerged, and give
the user a chance to figure out what factors they prioritized in their decision
when choosing a clinic.<br>
To test my assumptions, I created a set of tasks based on the three most frequently asked questions I encountered during my working clinic experience.</p>

<h5>Task #1: Use the site to see whether a physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment would be better for you</h5>
<h6>People did not understand what they were reading</h6>
<!-- <img class='research-tasks' src='/images/northville/task-1.svg' alt='Task 1'>
<p>This created a problem because there was an increased risk of information being missed. 60% of users would’ve just called or left the site if they couldn’t find what they were looking for. 
Calling for information defeated the purpose of having the it on the website, and adds an extra step to the conversion process.</p> -->

<h5>Task #2: Do they accept private insurance or extended
health coverage</h5>
<h6>People were overwhelmed when just navigating a site they
thought was too text-heavy</h6>
<!-- <img class='research-tasks' src='/images/northville/task-2.svg' alt='Task 2'>
<p class='p-sub'>When they were overwhelmed, various outcomes were observed:</p>
  <p><ul>
    <li>risk of no trust being developed</li>
    <li>leaving the site in frustration</li>
    <li>calling to find out information, thus adding an extra step to the conversion process</li>
  </ul></p>
 -->
<h5>Task #3: Try to book an appointment</h5>
<h6>People expected to be guided on how they should take action</h6>
<!-- <img class='research-tasks' src='images/northville/task-3.svg' alt='Task 3'>
<p>If there was no guidance or instructions on how to book an appointment, users were uncertain whether they had missed an online booking option. This would’ve resulted in calling or emailing (adding an extra step to the conversion) or leaving the site in frustration. </p> -->

<h5>Primary Research Impressions:</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Copywriting needs to be simple so it can be understood by the users</li>
  <li>Keywords are how users navigate the site to fit their needs</li>
  <li>Large bodies of text are often skimmed or skipped</li>
  <li>Users expect clear guidance on how to take action</li>
  <li>Practitioner biographies do not hold as high of a priority as services
information</li>
<li>Information must be easy to find and match people’s mental models</li>
<li>Factors that are users always look for are:<br>
    - services information<br>
    - insurance information<br>
    - how to book an appointment</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Secondary research: contextual inquiry</h5>
    <h6>Assessing how competitors structured their task flow</h6>

<img class='competitors' src='/images/northville/competitors.svg' alt='Competitor Logos'>


<h5>Goals:</h5>
 <ol>
    <li>Who are the direct competitors?</li>
    <li>What factors do they think are important to promote their clinic?</li>
    <li>How do they lay out the specific factors that users think are
important on their website?</li>
</ol>
<p>From the primary research, the three most important factors when choosing a clinic were: 
  <ol>
    <li>Learning about the offered services</li>
    <li>Whether they accepted their insurance company</li>
    <li>Ease of booking an appointment</li> 
  </ol></p>
  <p> Four existing rehabiliation clinics were chosen at random. In the end, I hoped to find best practices and effective organization tactics
used to promote their clinic. </p>

<h5>Learning about the offered services</h5>
<h6>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation</h6>

<h5>Finding the insurance information</h5>
<h6>Interestingly, each site had their own placement of the
insurance information</h6>

<h5>Booking an appointment</h5>
<h6>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was a section related to "contact".</h6>


<input id='CTA' type='button' value='Detailed Analysis' onclick="myFunction()"></input>
      <div id='secondary-research'>
      	<h5>Learning about the offered services</h5>
<p></p>>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation.Each service had it’s own desinated page, and a description
explaining the following:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>what the treatment or discipline is about</li>
<li>what the therapist will do</li>
<li>what kind of benefits to expect</li>
</ul></p>

<h5>Finding the insurance information</h5>
<p>Interestingly, each site had their own placement of the
insurance information. It was not under its own heading in the global navigation, but
found under different sections such as “FAQ”, “site map”,
“services”, or “pricing”.<br>
This suggests that the clinics think this is secondary information
and don’t place that much priority on it.</p>

<h5>Booking an appointment</h5>
<p>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was a section related to "contact". If the clinic offered online booking, there would be a CTA linking to it.
If the clinic did not offer online booking, the information was usually
under “contact”, organized by location.
Under “contact” was the clinic details, including the address, email,
phone/fax, and hours of operation. Interestingly, not all sites used the
word “contact” in the global navigation. Alternatives would be
“locations” or “about me”.
If there was more than one location, the contact information would be
organized by location on one page.</p>

<div class='copywriting'>
  <h5>Content Copywriting</h5>
  <p>From the user research, it was clear that a copywriting revamp was needed on the website. </p>

<img src='/images/northville/copywriting-stats.svg' alt='Copywriting Statistics'> 

<p>Before doing any writing, I first established the user’s goals and motivations for wanting to read any clinic service information.</p>
<h6><u>Goal:</u> Users wanted to choose the appropriate type of therapy to book with.<br> 
<u>Need:</u> In order to accomplish this, they had to read and learn about the offered services.</h6>

<p class='p-sub'>I referenced Mailchimp’s fantastic style guide and wrote out four questions to focus on:
  <ol>
  <li>What is the service</li>
  <li>How do they carry out their treatment</li>
  <li>What do they treat</li>
  <li>What benefits does their treatment provide?</li>
  </ol></p>
<p>By focusing on answering these four questions, I hoped to provide clarity to prospective users in a concise and digestible format. 
To match Northville’s brand attributes, the content was written in a professional and plainspoken tone.</p>

</div>

<div class='cardSort'>
  <h5>Card Sorting</h5>
  <p>Before building the site, it was important to me to create an architecture that was the most intuitive to the user flow. If I had learned anything from the competitive analysis, it was that:</p>
  <h6>There is no  best “information architecture pattern” for placement of certain information.</h6>

<div class='columns'>
  <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 80px;">
  <h5>High Level Goals</h5>
  <p><ol>
    <li>Where did people think to look for clinic details?</li>
<li>If there was no payment heading, how and where would people look for insurance
information?</li></ol></p></div>
<div>
<h5>Details</h5>
<p>
Platform: remote card sorting activity via OptimalSort<br>
Participants: eight<br>
Number of cards: eight</p></div>

The percentage indicates the number of participants who sorted the card (left) into the corresponding category (top).</figcaption>
</figure>

<h5>Where did people think to look for clinic details?</h5>
<h6>“Contact” would be the most likely place people would look.</h6>
<p>The competitor analysis showed this information under two headings: "contact" and "book now". To figure out where users expected to find these details, I created cards with the clinic phone number and address. The results of the study showed that "contact" won by an overwhelming amount. Only 13% of users categorized the phone number under “book now”, while 75% of users categorized it under “contact”.</p>

<h5>How and where would people look for insurance information?</h5>
<h6>“Private insurance” is the more widely recognized term, and “services” is the most likely place people would look.</h6>
<p>During the research, it was a clear user expectation to see insurance information under a fee schedule type of category. This coincided with the competitor analysis as well, where some sites placed the information with their fee schedule for services. To avoid confusing users, I initially suggested placing this under a payment-related heading with the fees of each service, but the client expressed that they did not wish to advertise their prices for their own reasons.<br>
	The card sorting results were helpful, because it showed the highest percentages for both “private insurance” and “extended health coverage” was under the category "services".This suggested that out of the pre-determined categories, this is where majority of the users would think to look.
In a surprise twist, the footer category was also shown to be a second option with 25% of users. This is most likely because users use the footer as a place to re-orient themselves or find extra information. In a surprise twist, the footer category was also shown to be a second option with 25% of users. This is most likely because users use the footer as a place to re-orient themselves or find extra information.<br>

	During the research, it also became apparent that not all users know the terms "private insurance" and "extended health coverage” are interchangeable. To see which was more recognized, I added both terms into the card sorting. 
38% of users categorized “private insurance” and only 25% categorized “extended health coverage”. I interpreted this to mean that because “private insurance” had a higher percentage, it suggested more recognition.<br>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Since the design was going to be put into the world for real users to navigate, I wanted to ensure that my designs were up to par and that the task and user flows were intuitive. For this reason, I decided to conduct two rounds of usability testing. I created <a href='miro.com'>affinity maps</a> based on the data collected for each round of testing.

<div id='cnav-improvements' class='improvements'>
<h4>06. Improvements</h4>
<h5>Task #1:  Find the common conditions treated by chiropractic</h5>
<p>In the beginning, it was hard for users to keep their eye engaged on the discipline details page because of the amount of whitespace around the elements. In the iterations, I was mindful about this and made sure to better use the page's real-estate. I made layout changes and utlized the concept of the user's eye travelling in a introduced a second column for the "common conditions". This took advantage of the user's <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/' target='_blank'>natural eye movement in the "F" pattern</a> and kept them engaged while reading.</p>

<h5>Task #2: Find out if they accept private insurance</h5>
<p>Though all the users ended up completing the task, there were several barriers along the way. They disliked scrolling through information that was irrelevant to their task. They also expressed being visually overwhelmed by a section full of insurance logos. <i>"I'd like the option to ctrl+f my insurance company to find out if the clinic works with them"</i> - user comment. <br> I took this feedback and decided to create a separate page with a list of all the insurance providers that the clinic work with.</p>

<h5>Task #3: Try to book an appointment</h5>
<p>This task proved to be the trickiest out of all three. All three participants had different ideas of how to complete the task, and each encountered different problems. The footer CTA to book an appointment was not noticed, and the wording caused users to expect an online booking feature. If they didn't see the footer, users went to the services page thinking they'd be able to book an appointment after choosing a service or discipline. The copywriting on the contact page felt redundant to users, and provided no actual guidance on how to book an appointment. As a result, I was compelled to re-examine the <a href=#userflow>user flows</a> I had initially created based on the research. It was here where I noted all the different points at which a user would consider booking an appointment. Coupled with observing how people approached the task during the usability testing, it became obvious that I needed to incorporate more opportunities for people to book an appointment. The second round of usability testing was a huge win, because all users completed the task with no issues (yay!).

<h5>Layout</h5>
<p>While the first round of testing was mainly focused on task flows, the second round showed that improvements needed to be made to the UI. The colour palette I used on the site was originally only Northville’s signature brand colour of royal blue. Though it really stayed showed a professional brand attribute, users felt offput and couldn't connect with the clinic. <br>
In the iterated version (right), <span class='highlight'>I used warmer tones that would make the users feel more comfortable while navigating an information-dense site. I also hoped that the warmer yellows and blues would help further instill brand trust within the clinic.</span></p>

<div class='takeaways'>
<h4 id='cnav-learnings'>07. Learnings</h4>
Redesigning the website for my old clinic brought me back all kinds of nostalgia from my early career. I loved being able to accomplish one of my dreams of returning to the healthcare industry through a design lens to improve a patients' user experience. I hope that the redesign helps educate the younger demographic on the benefits of rehabiliative therapy and maintenance care to keep your physical body in tip top shape!
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1. Function over form</dt>
	<dd>I learned that you can have valuable information on a website, but if it's not designed or organized in an engaging format, users aren't going to notice it. With Mailchimp's help, I had a crash course on how to create concise content that educates the user without overwhelming them. I was given the opportunity to observe how users navigate (or don't navigate) information-dense sites, and how bullet points, headers, and use of whitespace can keep a user engaged.</dd><br>
	<dt>2. Multiple Flows</dt>
	<dd>We learn that people have different mental models when approaching a task. However, seeing it in practice with my design helped me understand that there doesn't have to be one flow us designers create to accomplish a task. The essence of UX is to create an experience that is frictionless to those who use the product. I was stuck in the mindset that I had to create one optimal flow to complete a task, but this showed me that I can provide multiple opportunities throughout the website to cater to different ways of thinking.</dd><br>
	<dt>3. Power of colour theory</dt>
	<dd>It was great to incorporate Northville's brand colour throughout the site, but that stark colour contrast is what most likely limited the site in its branding. The clinic looked one dimensional in only giving the vibe of professionalism, and it didn't connect with the users. By incorporating the warmer tones, users felt more comfortable while navigating and would be more inclined to trust this clinic with their healthcare.</dd>
