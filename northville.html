    <h6>Background</h6>
    <p>Northville Rehabilitation Centre is a multidisciplinary clinic located in Markham, ON. This is the
second location that the owners have opened, with the first location having been in operation for
over 30 years. Though word of mouth is currently their primary source of referrals, Northville
would like to expand their marketing efforts and audience demographic.</p></div>

  <h6>Design Opportunity</h6>
  <p>As a new and local rehabilitation clinic, Northville’s goal is to increase their number of walk-ins and referrals. With over 55% of millenials researching their healthcare online (and finding it just as reliable as a doctor), Northville hopes to establish its online presence and align its values with this younger demographic and the community.</p>

<!-- don Norman quote <img style='margin-bottom:30px' src='images/queue/quote-DN.svg' alt='Don Norman quote'></a> -->

<h6>Design Solution</h6>
<p>By creating an educational and responsive website, Northville hopes to capture the younger millenial demographic. Revamped copywriting will help succintly inform website visitors on offered clinic services and their benefits. Coupled with an intuitive informational architecture, website visitors can easily navigate around and make an informed decision about their health.</p></div>

<!-- RESEARCH SECTION -->
<img class='text-box' src='images/northville/research-user.svg' alt='User Research'>

<!-- To test my assumptions, I created a set of tasks based on the three most frequently asked questions I encountered during my working clinic experience.</p>

<h5>Task #1: Use the site to see whether a physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment would be better for you</h5>
<h6>People did not understand what they were reading</h6> -->
<!-- <img class='research-tasks' src='/images/northville/task-1.svg' alt='Task 1'>
<p>This created a problem because there was an increased risk of information being missed. 60% of users would’ve just called or left the site if they couldn’t find what they were looking for. 
Calling for information defeated the purpose of having the it on the website, and adds an extra step to the conversion process.</p> -->

<!-- <h5>Task #2: Do they accept private insurance or extended
health coverage</h5>
<h6>People were overwhelmed when just navigating a site they
thought was too text-heavy</h6> -->
<!-- <img class='research-tasks' src='/images/northville/task-2.svg' alt='Task 2'>
<p class='p-sub'>When they were overwhelmed, various outcomes were observed:</p>
  <p><ul>
    <li>risk of no trust being developed</li>
    <li>leaving the site in frustration</li>
    <li>calling to find out information, thus adding an extra step to the conversion process</li>

<p>If there was no guidance or instructions on how to book an appointment, users were uncertain whether they had missed an online booking option. This would’ve resulted in calling or emailing (adding an extra step to the conversion) or leaving the site in frustration. </p> -->

<!-- <h6>User Research Takeaways:</h6>
<ol>

  <li>Large bodies of text are often skimmed or skipped</li>
  <li>Users expect clear guidance on how to take action</li>
  <li>Practitioner biographies do not hold as high of a priority as services
information</li>
<li>Information must be easy to find and match people’s mental models</li>

  <h4>Empathy Map</h4>
  <h5>Understanding the average user</h5>
  <p>I created an empathy map based on the collective data to help remind me of the user expectations that I was designing for. I found that the redesign had to be focused around the assumption that the average user had no prior knowledge of any medical or rehabilitation terminology.</p></div>

<div class='section'>
  <h4>Competitor task flow comparison</h4>
    <h5>What’re the best practices in existing sites?</h5>

<p>I assessed four random existing clinic websites based on the top three factors that people considered when choosing a clinic:
  <ol>
    <li>Learning about the offered services</li>
    <li>Whether they accepted their insurance company</li>
    <li>Ease of booking an appointment</li> 
  </ol></p>

  <img class='competitors' src='/images/northville/competitors.svg' alt='Competitor Logos'>
  <p>In the end, I hoped to find the best practices and effective organization tactics that competitors used to promtoe their clinic.</p>

<h6>Competitor takeaways</h6>
<ol>
	<li>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation</li>
<li>There is no consistent placement for insurance information</li>
<li>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was under a section related to "contact".</li>
</ol>
</div>

<input id='CTA' type='button' value='Detailed Analysis' onclick="myFunction()"></input>
      <div id='secondary-research'>
      	<h5>Learning about the offered services</h5>
<p></p>>All the sites had their offered services under “services” in the
global navigation.Each service had it’s own desinated page, and a description
explaining the following:</p>
<p><ul>
<li>what the treatment or discipline is about</li>
<li>what the therapist will do</li>
<li>what kind of benefits to expect</li>
</ul></p>

<h5>Finding the insurance information</h5>
<p>Interestingly, each site had their own placement of the
insurance information. It was not under its own heading in the global navigation, but
found under different sections such as “FAQ”, “site map”,
“services”, or “pricing”.<br>
This suggests that the clinics think this is secondary information
and don’t place that much priority on it.</p>

<h5>Booking an appointment</h5>
<p>If clinics didn't offer online booking, the booking information was a section related to "contact". If the clinic offered online booking, there would be a CTA linking to it.
If the clinic did not offer online booking, the information was usually
under “contact”, organized by location.
Under “contact” was the clinic details, including the address, email,
phone/fax, and hours of operation. Interestingly, not all sites used the
word “contact” in the global navigation. Alternatives would be
“locations” or “about me”.
If there was more than one location, the contact information would be
organized by location on one page.</p>

  <h4>Remote card sorting analysis</h4>
  <h5>Addressing information architecture assumptions</h5>
  <div class='columns'>
  <div style="width: 70%; padding-right: 80px;">
  <p>Since I wasn't able to obtain familiar design patterns from competitors, I decided to ask the users msyself through a cardsorting activity. In keeping with the business' goals, it was important to create an architecture that was intuitive to the user’s flow. I wanted to find out:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Where would people look for clinic details?</li>
    <li>Where would people look for insurance information?</li></ol>

<h4>Card sorting takeaways</h4>
<ol>

  <li>“Private insurance” or "Extended Health Coverage" are interchangeable terms, and “services” is the most likely place people would look.</li>

  <h6>Low fidelity wireframes</h6>
  <p>Thanks to the above learnings, I had a better idea of the type of content needed on the website. It was finally time to design! Since I wasn’t creating any new pages, I referenced the site’s existing site map and drew out potential layouts for diffrent pages. During the weekly check-in, the client and I chose what would be the best. </p>

<!-- <h5>Where did people think to look for clinic details?</h5>
<h6>“Contact” would be the most likely place people would look.</h6>
<p>The competitor analysis showed this information under two headings: "contact" and "book now". To figure out where users expected to find these details, I created cards with the clinic phone number and address. The results of the study showed that "contact" won by an overwhelming amount. Only 13% of users categorized the phone number under “book now”, while 75% of users categorized it under “contact”.</p>

<h5>How and where would people look for insurance information?</h5>
<h6>“Private insurance” is the more widely recognized term, and “services” is the most likely place people would look.</h6>
<p>During the research, it was a clear user expectation to see insurance information under a fee schedule type of category. This coincided with the competitor analysis as well, where some sites placed the information with their fee schedule for services. To avoid confusing users, I initially suggested placing this under a payment-related heading with the fees of each service, but the client expressed that they did not wish to advertise their prices for their own reasons.<br>
	The card sorting results were helpful, because it showed the highest percentages for both “private insurance” and “extended health coverage” was under the category "services".This suggested that out of the pre-determined categories, this is where majority of the users would think to look.
In a surprise twist, the footer category was also shown to be a second option with 25% of users. This is most likely because users use the footer as a place to re-orient themselves or find extra information. In a surprise twist, the footer category was also shown to be a second option with 25% of users. This is most likely because users use the footer as a place to re-orient themselves or find extra information.<br>

	During the research, it also became apparent that not all users know the terms "private insurance" and "extended health coverage” are interchangeable. To see which was more recognized, I added both terms into the card sorting. 
38% of users categorized “private insurance” and only 25% categorized “extended health coverage”. I interpreted this to mean that because “private insurance” had a higher percentage, it suggested more recognition.<br>

<h4>06. Improvements</h4>
<h5>Task #1:  Find the common conditions treated by chiropractic</h5>
<p>In the beginning, it was hard for users to keep their eye engaged on the discipline details page because of the amount of whitespace around the elements. In the iterations, I was mindful about this and made sure to better use the page's real-estate. I made layout changes and utlized the concept of the user's eye travelling in a introduced a second column for the "common conditions". This took advantage of the user's <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/' target='_blank'>natural eye movement in the "F" pattern</a> and kept them engaged while reading.</p>

<h5>Task #2: Find out if they accept private insurance</h5>
<p>Though all the users ended up completing the task, there were several barriers along the way. They disliked scrolling through information that was irrelevant to their task. They also expressed being visually overwhelmed by a section full of insurance logos. <i>"I'd like the option to ctrl+f my insurance company to find out if the clinic works with them"</i> - user comment. <br> I took this feedback and decided to create a separate page with a list of all the insurance providers that the clinic work with.</p>

<h5>Task #3: Try to book an appointment</h5>
<p>This task proved to be the trickiest out of all three. All three participants had different ideas of how to complete the task, and each encountered different problems. The footer CTA to book an appointment was not noticed, and the wording caused users to expect an online booking feature. If they didn't see the footer, users went to the services page thinking they'd be able to book an appointment after choosing a service or discipline. The copywriting on the contact page felt redundant to users, and provided no actual guidance on how to book an appointment. As a result, I was compelled to re-examine the <a href=#userflow>user flows</a> I had initially created based on the research. It was here where I noted all the different points at which a user would consider booking an appointment. Coupled with observing how people approached the task during the usability testing, it became obvious that I needed to incorporate more opportunities for people to book an appointment. The second round of usability testing was a huge win, because all users completed the task with no issues (yay!).

<h5>Layout</h5>
<p>While the first round of testing was mainly focused on task flows, the second round showed that improvements needed to be made to the UI. The colour palette I used on the site was originally only Northville’s signature brand colour of royal blue. Though it really stayed showed a professional brand attribute, users felt offput and couldn't connect with the clinic. <br>
In the iterated version (right), <span class='highlight'>I used warmer tones that would make the users feel more comfortable while navigating an information-dense site. I also hoped that the warmer yellows and blues would help further instill brand trust within the clinic.</span></p> -->

<div class='takeaways'>
<h4 id='cnav-learnings'>07. Learnings</h4>
Redesigning the website for my old clinic brought me back all kinds of nostalgia from my early career. I loved being able to accomplish one of my dreams of returning to the healthcare industry through a design lens to improve a patients' user experience. I hope that the redesign helps educate the younger demographic on the benefits of rehabiliative therapy and maintenance care to keep your physical body in tip top shape!
	<p>
	<dl>
	<dt>1. Function over form</dt>
	<dd>I learned that you can have valuable information on a website, but if it's not designed or organized in an engaging format, users aren't going to notice it. With Mailchimp's help, I had a crash course on how to create concise content that educates the user without overwhelming them. I was given the opportunity to observe how users navigate (or don't navigate) information-dense sites, and how bullet points, headers, and use of whitespace can keep a user engaged.</dd><br>
	<dt>2. Multiple Flows</dt>
	<dd>We learn that people have different mental models when approaching a task. However, seeing it in practice with my design helped me understand that there doesn't have to be one flow us designers create to accomplish a task. The essence of UX is to create an experience that is frictionless to those who use the product. I was stuck in the mindset that I had to create one optimal flow to complete a task, but this showed me that I can provide multiple opportunities throughout the website to cater to different ways of thinking.</dd><br>
	<dt>3. Power of colour theory</dt>
	<dd>It was great to incorporate Northville's brand colour throughout the site, but that stark colour contrast is what most likely limited the site in its branding. The clinic looked one dimensional in only giving the vibe of professionalism, and it didn't connect with the users. By incorporating the warmer tones, users felt more comfortable while navigating and would be more inclined to trust this clinic with their healthcare.</dd>
