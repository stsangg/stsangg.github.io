  <h4 id='intro-hey'>Hey there! 👋🏻</h4>
  <p id='intro'>I’m Stephanie, your local Toronto product designer.<br>
I design with the philosophy of discovering a user’s why. Through research-based decisions, I create user-centric products.</p>

  <div class='history'>
  <h5>🔍 Researching for thoughtful insights</h5>
    <p>I graduated with a degree in health sciences. Being in a research and evidence-based environment for four years, I learned how to craft research questions and analyze data. This helped me to synthesize meaningful insights. 
</p>
    
    <h5>👥 Managing people and procedures</h5>
    <p>For two years, I managed the day to day operations of a rehabilitation clinic. During that time, I was able to streamline 75% of existing clinic procedures through identifying co-workers' frustrations from conversations and observations. Administrative procedures such as tracking the progress of clinical notes and records were outdated, and a simple tracking sheet solution I created improved the turnover rate by 50%. After eight months, I was promoted and went from streamlining to creating. </p>

         <h5>👩🏻‍💻 Creating user-centric plans</h5>
    <p>Having interacted with over 100+ MVC (motor vehicle collision) patients, I started creating the doctor-recommended treatment plans to submit to insurance companies. I’d tailor the recommendations to the habits and preferences of the patient, whilst communicating with the insurance companies on why the treatment was necessary. For example, if acupuncture therapy was recommended but I knew the patient had a phobia of needles, I’d make the appropriate treatment substitution for the patient. Advocating for the patient was always the best way to help reach their goals. </p>

    <h5>✏️ Designing impactful solutions</h5>
    <p>My previous experiences guide my design thinking. I pursued UX Design because it gives me the opportunity to solve problems through impactful solutions. By utilizing my skills and experiences, I’m able to design with both business and user goals in mind. </p>

    <h5>📚 Learning and growing</h5>
    <p>Humbled by the <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2019/1/31/18200497/dunning-kruger-effect-explained-trump">Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE)</a>, I approach learning with an open mind. When things get tough (and they usually do - see portfolio log), DKE gives me the reassurance to persevere and know that I’m challenging myself to grow as a thinker and designer. Through learning, I hope to better understand my team members’ needs and goals in their fields of work, and increase my potential as a collaborator and communicator.

    <h5>🧗🏻‍♀️Latest Challenges:</h5>
    <h6>#dailyUIchallenge</h6>
    <p>For this challenge, I’ve set out to complete 1 design prompt per day for 100 days. By dedicating time to explore design patterns, I’m able to methodically approach visual design to create my own library of resources and design systems for future use.
 </p>
    <h6>Coding</h6>
    <p>The concept of code translating into a webpage was something I always thought was fascinating. Its logical structure matched my systematic way of thinking, and I began to learn the language on freecodecamp.com. As a way to showcase my progress and skills, I decided to code this portfolio myself! Check out here for a log of its updates.</p>
    <h5>Previous challenges:</h5>
    <ul>
