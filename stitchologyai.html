	<p class='P3'>Information architecture, Copywriting, UI design</p>
	<p class='P1'>How often have you read something, but not actually understood it? Without understanding, how can you learn or action on that information? stitchology.ai identified this gap in knowledge when entrepreneurs use data-collecting apps, and focused on creating a product that would help users understand their e-commerce analytics and help them grow their brand through actionable recommendations.</p>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='P3'>Problem</p>
	<p class='H1'>people don’t understand their metrics</p>
	<p class='P1'>Through user interviews, we found people didn't understand the metrics they were tracking and didn't know how to plan for next steps to achieve goals and scale their business.</p>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='P3'>Solution</p>
	<p class='P1'>With <a href=#iteration> multiple iterations </a> under the belt, I created a dashboard that visually communicated a brand's metrics. I approached the design with the intention of anchoring a user's focus to truly understand and know how to utilize each measured metric.</p>

	<div class='section-bg-txt'>
		<p class='P2'>Notable highlights that resulted:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Information architecture that showed how each category impacted the overall conversion score</li>
			<li>Copywriting that framed definitions in a similar way brand owners were thinking</li>
			<li>UI design using modular cards and icons for focus, visual balance, and scalability</li>
		</ol>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='P3'>Impact</p>
	<p class='P1'>With only a prototype demo, {x} new brands have signed on. The app is currently being developed to support these new brands, in addition to the {x} previous brands that were already associated.</p>

	<p class='P3'>Information architecture</p>
	<p class='H1'>Approaching from the top-down</p>
	<p class='P1'>Stitchology.ai measures the usability, engagement, and stickiness of a brand owner’s products and visitors, and compares the data against similar brands. The problem was how to best organize the information for the user and show the data’s relationship to the overall conversion score. </p>
	<img src='assets/stitchologyai/infoarchitecture.png' alt='Information architecture'>
	<p class='P1'>I decided to approach it from a top-down perspective. The conversion score was calculated through the three categories, and each category was influenced by the sub-categories.</p>
	<p class='P1'>With this perspective, we leveraged our core branding metrics (usability, engagement, and stickiness) as our main tabs in the information architecture.</p>

	<p class='P3'>Copywriting</p>
	<p class='H1'>Reducing cognitive load</p>
	<p class='P1'>The research constantly reminded me of the knowledge gap users had when reading metric definitions. A pattern I began to notice, was that our users were constantly relating the metric back to their business and asking themselves how and why the data mattered in relation to their business. I attributed this quality to their constant growth mindset.</p>
<!-- 	insert the image here -->
	<p class='P1'>Taking inspiration from our users, I structured definitions as questions they would ask themselves. I hoped it would help reduce the cognitive load and help them better understand and utilize the metrics.</p>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='P3'>UI Design</p>
	<p class='H1'>anchoring focus and understanding with cards</p>
	<p class='P1'>I used a card design so the user could focus their attention on one metric (card) at a time. While early iterations were great for showing the data, our users felt overwhelmed by the amount of metrics and wanted more contextual information.</p>
	<!-- insert the image here -->

	<p class='P1'>To mitigate the problem, I decided to create a single layout that could be applied to all cards. I also made it a point to properly define the metric so the user would understand what we were tracking and how to use the information.</p>

<div class='section'>
	<p class='H1'>icons providing visual breaks</p>
	<p class='P1'>Working to understand your brand’s metrics can be cognitively demanding. To prevent cognitive overload, I looked for places to replace text with icons. I used the ones below to represent the main categories.</p>
	<div class='image'>
		<img src='assets/stitchologyai/icons.png'>
	</div>
	<p class='P1'>The icons not only helped break up the text, but also provided more opportunities to communicate information on a page that could be easily scanned without sacrificing information.</p>

	<p class='H1'>Final product</p>
	<p class='P1'>The app is currently being developed. In the meantime, my energy is directed towards usability testing with our brands. Though research has been used to design features, we’ve also made some assumptions. In my testing, I’ll be focusing on validating the information architecture and ensuring users and understanding the icons.</p>
